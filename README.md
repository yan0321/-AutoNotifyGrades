# -AutoNotifyGrades

Instead of waiting and constantly refreshing the page, I have created an automation to check my grades automatically. :)
Automated tool that can monitor my grades and notify me when I achieve a certain grade level.
The code creates a GUI window to prompt the user for login credentials and an element ID. It then uses Selenium to access a website, locate the chosen element ID, and check for new grades. If new grades are found, it sends a notification via the Pushbullet API and displays a pop-up message with the grades.
